Project to Learn Micro Frontend
Micro frontends are an intriguing approach to building scalable and maintainable web applications. Letâ€™s dive into creating a course on implementing micro frontends using Angular. Here are the key steps:

Understanding Micro Frontends:
Micro frontends break down a web application into smaller, independent parts based on business domains or functionality.
Each micro frontend is like a subset of the larger application, encapsulating specific functionality or related features.
Setting Up the Environment:
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
Install Angular CLI globally: npm install -g @angular/cli@16.
Create a new Angular project: ng new my-micro-frontend-app.
Architectural Design:
Plan how to divide your application into micro frontends.
For example, in an e-commerce app, you might have separate micro frontends for product search, cart management, and checkout.
These micro frontends should be independent enough to operate on their own but also capable of integrating into the main application.
Module Federation with Angular:
Leverage Webpackâ€™s Module Federation feature.
This allows dynamically loading modules from other applications, crucial for micro frontends.
Different teams can develop, compile, and deploy micro frontends independently.
Communication Between Micro Frontends:
Define an API contract for communication between micro frontends.
Keep communication minimal and well-defined to avoid complicated dependencies.
Build and Deploy:
Build each micro frontend individually.
Seamlessly integrate them into a cohesive product.
Deploy your micro frontend-based application.
Remember, micro frontends enhance scalability, improve team efficiency, and allow flexibility in technology use. Happy coding! ðŸš€
